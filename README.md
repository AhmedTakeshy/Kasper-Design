## Overview

### Description

- The incentive of creating this project to demonstrate the uses of flex system combined with grid system, and to show the ability of doing that.
- Using media quires to reach the maximum level of responding to various screen on different devices.
- One of the problem I faced that how to manage using grid and flex system parallel to each other, whether vertically or horizontally so I used everyone of them depending on their auto flow.
